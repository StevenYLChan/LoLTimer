# LoLTimer

This application allows you to add timers while in a game of League of Legends. The tool utilizes the notes field and usage is by typing "/n (text) (time)"
Example: "/n annie flash 180". This will create a timer and will signal a text to speech sound and text alert after the alotted time in seconds. 

This program can be built into an exe by using Py2Exe or can be run by simpling clicking on  'lol_windows_timer_27.exe' in the Executables folder.
Note: The directory_file.txt in this folder always needs to be in sync with the current version of league of legends or else the program will not run.
